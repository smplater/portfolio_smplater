          <p class="text-center py-1">
            Audubon Labs is a sound engineering and recording studio looking to
            expand thier artist community. Sean Jackson, the founder of Audubon, noticed that many of
            bookings were being coordinated by word of mouth and there would
            often be confusion as to when musicians were scheduled to come in.
            He recognized that he needed a system that would make it simple for
            artists to look up Audubon Labs and immidiately book a session
            online. Audubon also wanted the capacity to promote their aritsts by
            sharing music directly on their site and linking their artists'
            social media pages and other music sharing platforms on their site as well. This would not only
            encourage users to share and listen to the music they found on Audubon's
            site, but this feature would also serve to act as a promotion tool for Audubon's services.

            1. Audubon often had scheduling conflics and miscommunications due

          <h3 class="text-center py-1">
            2. Audubon lacked the capacity to showcase the music they produced

        <h1>My Role</h1>
        <p>
          My role in this project was to take Sean Jackson's bussiness
          objectives and design a website and a mobile app that would deliver a solution to his
          scheduling challeneges. We also discussed the possibilities for directly sharing music on Audubon's website to promote their
          artists and services.

        <h3>UX RESEARCHER</h3>
        <p>
          One of my primary responisibilities in this project was conducting
          thorough user research. I used a combination of user interviews, user surveys, and
          usability tests in order to get direct feedback from my targeted users
          quickly.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>UX/UI DESIGNER</h3>
        <p>
          I created a user flow and then designed desktop and mobile layouts that mapped to that user journey I created through my research; and made sure my designs would allow users to book a session specific to their needs. I wanted my pages to be intuitive, aesthetically exciting, and simple, so that users would want to return to book another session with Audubon.

          <h3 class="text-center">
            In order to conduct user research for this project I first
            identified the demographics of my target user and created a couple
            of user personas based on phone call interviews I conducted with
            some of Audubon's current recording artists.
            Based on those conversations I collected a set of data that was
            related to the artists' familiarity with other recodring studios in
            New York and what they expected to encounter when booking either a
            rehearsal space, recording session, or mixing session.
          </h3>
          <br>
          <h3 class="text-center"> Throughout the research process I focused on what
            was required to book a recording session online and what made
            that process enjoyable or frustrating.  Due to this being a solo 
            project, I conducted all of the user research through google hangouts 
            and online surveys, and then analyzed the data to create accurate user 
            personas and design a user journey that aligned with what artists would 
            want out of the specific pages and features.</h3>

              <p>
                Through my conversations with Audubon's recording artists, I
                realized that Audubon's demographic differed greatly in the
                number of years that they have been recording, which also
                affected what they looked for when book a recording session at a
                professional studio.

              <h3>Purpose for Recording</h3>
              <p>
                One of the first themes I noticed from my user research was that
                evry artist I spoke with wanted to record their music in order
                to share it with a wider audience. This made a lot of sense
                considering that musicians wouldn't pay the extra fee to record
                in a studio unless they wanted to create great sounding music in
                order to share it with their audience.

              <h3>Put the fine print upfront</h3>
              <p>
                Based on my user interviews, I noticed that no matter whether
                the user was a seasoned recording artist or a total newby, the
                number one thing they look for when booking studio time is the
                pricing. Usually if a musician is taking the time and money to
                book studio time, chances are they have a budget in mind and
                access to comparison tools that will give them plenty of
                opportunity to find alternatives.

              <p>Keeping some of the important details in the first step of the booking process reminds the users of Audubon's setup and services, so they don't have to go to a new page on the site just to check if they will have everything they need. I find that this makes the scheduling process easier on the user and releives the mental burden of having to dig to find critical information.</p>

          <p>
            I began my UX Design process by first consulting with the founder of
            Audubon, Sean Jackson, and other stakeholders to discuss
            goals and current challeneges he was facing in the
            scope of scheduling and promotion. I then spoke with Audubon's recording artists in order to gain insights
            about what they liked about Audubon's studio and rehearsal space.

            In my preliminary research I interviewed a set of users that met my user persona criteria and had never booked a session with Audubon before, and asked them questions aboout their usual booking expereince. I also conducted competitor research to analyze how other companies handled online bookings.

      <p class="py-1 text-center"> I faced a number of challenges throughout this project, 
        the biggest being that I had to conduct a lot of testing and draw insights upon those outcomes on my own. Personally, I enjoy working collaboratively with others and I also think having other designers and devs generating ideas for a user expereince is highly benifical because you have more perspectives in a room to solve a problem.  </p>
       <h2 class="text-center">LESSONS LEARNED</h2>
       <p class="py-1 text-center">Working alone thoughout this process also taught me a lot about how to effictively organize a user research study and use those insights to develop my designs. Developing goals with business stakeholders is an important part of defining the scope of the project, but conducting user research and usability testing are were the biggest sources of influence for how my ideas looked on a screen and what the user journey should look like.</p>
